# Will you look at the time?

This is actually a very difficult post to write due to just how quickly this month has flown by. Starting this year, we've made the point of writing up on our whiteboard in "the office" our goals for the quarter - a general to do list. It feels like only yesterday that we were filling out our goals for Q2 and here we already are a third of the way through. Yikes!

## Spring, eh?

Winter officially ended more than five weeks ago and yet I still find myself wearing a jacket daily. At the beginning of this month we still had flurries of snow. Now heading into the long Maj√≥wka weekend, pandemic aside, anyone's plans for cook-outs have to be put on hold as it's supposed to be a cold and rainy one. C'est la vie.

# NFL Draft

This lands at an awkward time given the timing of these post, but day 1 of the draft is in the books! What do I think of [the Panthers taking Jaycee Horn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtIaN4KGKU0)? No idea! I am, as always, optimistic that good things are to come. In truth though, I find watching the [Hit, Miss, or Meh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MG3vJnoemyw) recaps - put out a few years after the fact, to be a good means of grounding myself. Every choice, no matter how sure it seems at the time, has some element of risk: will the player make the transition? Will they remain healthy? Will they be a good fit in their team's system? Only time will tell.

# What I'm working on

In this case, I mean more so what skill am I trying to develop. At present, [asynchronous programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_\(computer_programming\)) is all the rage. Every programming language handles the paradigm a little different though. While Rust has been finalizing its approach, Python has included an `asyncio` module in the standard library since version 3.4. As it is already an important part of my current work and certain to remain an important skill for years to come, I've decided that mastering these concepts needs to be a priority for me going forward. I'm starting with [this post](https://www.roguelynn.com/words/asyncio-we-did-it-wrong/) by Lynn Root. The basics of throwing in `async` and `await` keywords is easy to get a handle on; it's the deeper understand that allows me to be more creative and more efficient with my code that I'm after.
