## Hello

This is the first one of these that I'm writing so let's see how it goes.

## What I'm reading

I started the new year reading a book I received for Christmas, [Into the Planet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43131602-into-the-planet) by Jill Heinerth

I've generally shied away from biographies, auto or otherwise, as I don't like the aggrandizing that they often entail, but her experiences are so unique and foreign to me and my life that I quite enjoyed it. I've never felt the water to be my "natural environment", and so never considered scuba to be high on my bucket list, but the exploration Heinerth describes does certainly get at that primitive part of my brain that sometimes beckons me out of my comfort zone. *I recommend*.

In December I happened upon a few articles mentioning the passing of one [John le Carr√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_le_Carr%C3%A9), a British Intelligence Officer turned spy novelist. I average about one fiction book a year and with the holidays approaching I figured I might see if I couldn't find an inexpensive copy of his best known work, [The Spy Who Came In from the Cold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49988275-the-spy-who-came-in-from-the-cold), which fortunately I was able to do. It was rather short and I thought might make for light reading over the holiday. Instead I ended up putting off starting until mid-January. I'm rather torn about what to say about the novel, frankly. As promised, it was anything but the flash and pizzazz of earlier works in the genre (though I've never read any to compare). The prose is very matter-of-fact and certainly accurately reflects the world the author himself inhabited, but this doesn't necessarily make for a page-turner. All that being said, the final climax  of the book is arguably payoff enough, so *I don't not recommend*.

Back in 2017, starting anew in the land of Poles, I decided it was finally time to getting a deeper knowledge of my new home and so went in search of a book on the history of Poland, namely one without, insofar as is possible, any ideological bend. [This](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39128289-polska) is what I came up with:

![Polska by Adam Zamoyski cover](https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1520820711l/39128289._SX318_.jpg)

As you might notice from the cover - it's in Polish, which might be why I didn't actually carry through with my plan of diving into Polish history back in 2017. Now as I recommit myself to this land, bureaucratically at least, I've decided the time is nigh to dig in. I've read books in Polish in past and have usually opted to figure out as much of what I've not understood from context, but given the stakes that come with a country's history, I've opted to take it slow and methodically look up every last word I don't know out right. You can expect it to be a regular feature in these posts for months going forward :)

## How 'bout them NFL playoffs?

No more Tom Brady Super Bowls, please and thank you. It gives me no joy to root for Patrick Mahomes, but I've been left no choice.
