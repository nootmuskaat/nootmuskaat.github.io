# What I'm reading

In a normal month, I would probably talk about reading [Spillover](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17573681-spillover), and while I have been reading some, most of that time for me this month was spent towards more *professional* interests.

For those not in the know, my day job is as a [Python](https://www.python.org/) developer, where I serve as a technical lead. It's challenging work, but the fear of becoming stagnant is ever-present. As I am also beginning to perform technical interviews for my company, my sense that I need to expand my knowledge to be as competent as possible during these interviews is another factor. For this reason, I've spent a chunk of what would be my reading time this month on consuming Python talks, [like those from PyCon 2018](https://www.youtube.com/c/pycon2018/videos), to broaden my own base.

If I happened to pique your interest, the two talks I've seen so far that most opened my eyes up would be those by [Emily Morehouse-Valcarcel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhWvz4dK4ng) and [James Bennett](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSSpnq362Bk), which both tear down the curtain on the Python interpreter. For non-technical readers, this is undoubtedly too far down the rabbit hole, but should a fellow Dev come upon this post, hopefully they walk away with something interesting.

Related but not really to this is my other topic of interest this month: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I have slowly been working my way through the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) course. In past, I had shyed away from it, thinking that simply reading "[The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)" and supplementing with "[Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/)" would be more up my alley, but with Rust, the devil is in the details. Learning to read and understand code is important, but no one ever got hired just to do that :) so getting comfortable writing and working through problems has been fruitful. 

I would be remiss if I did not plug the best online resource I've found thus far for materials beyond those found on Rust's website: Mr [Jon Gjengset](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset/videos), whose videos have been enlightening and greatly expanded (and continue to expand) my own knowledge, not just of Rust, but computer science in general.

If you made it through all that - you're very kind! 

# Month 13 of the Pandemic

It was a year ago, March 13, that my boss told my colleague and me to head home from the office due to this whole coronavirus thing. During that time, the spouse and I renovated our new apartment, moved in, accumulated furniture, yada yada yada. Is time moving fast? slow? I have no answers. Anyways...

# Checking in on my New Years resolutions

It's the end of Q1, so a good time to look back at how my resolutions are going:

### Contribute to Open Source

Sadly, hasn't happened at all, unless we consider my own open source products. Hope to have more to report on this front at the end of Q2!

### Actually improving my Polish

Man, I'm really starting out 0 for 2 on these things. January was pretty productive on this front, but that's about it. Reviewing flash cards really isn't a lot of work and somehow I always talk myself out of it.

### Going hiking once a month

Also a fail in March, though January and February were successful. The weather this month has left a lot to be desired. I think we can count on some more hiking trips now that we're finally feeling Spring in the air.
