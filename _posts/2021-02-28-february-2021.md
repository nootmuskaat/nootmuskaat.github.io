## How about that Super Bowl?

I'm happy for the Buccaneers coaching staff, particularly [Todd Bowles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Bowles), and that's about the most positive spin I can put on the whole thing.

## What I'm reading

I had started the month by picking up [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens) but realized pretty quickly that it wasn't really where my head was and opted for lighter fare, picking up [Eiger Dreams by Jon Krakauer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1897.Eiger_Dreams), who had later gone on to write [Into Thin Air](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1898.Into_Thin_Air), a personal favorite of mine.

As a collection of his articles, they run the gamut, but particularly in this time of lockdown, they provided a nice mental escape. As I found while reading Into ThinAir, Krakauer can tell an incredibly gripping story when recounting events he's experienced, and those chapters (namely the first and last) deliver. *I recommend* as light reading to those interested in hiking.

At present, I'm slowly working my way through [Spillover](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17573681-spillover), a book about zoonotic diseases - a particularly relavant topic today. You'll just have to wait till next month for my review. All of which brings me to...

## When I don't feel like reading

In 2019 I set as a New Years resolution that I would read a book a month that year. While I didn't quite acheive that goal, the underlying theme - wanting to make a habit of reading - has certainly stuck with me and I have endeavored to make the time to read on a daily basis. That being said, there are some days and even weeks when frankly the content my brain seems to crave is not in any book that I would summarize here. In the waning days of 2019, for an extended stretch, it was foreign languages. Obviously oblivious to the upcoming pandemic and believing a trip to Japan was in my future, I found myself reading through [kanji glyph origins](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%8C%81#Glyph_origin) and Japanese grammar. As you can imagine, my momentum and motiviation in this domain diminished rather rapidly after the onset of lockdown and travel restrictions.

I bring this up because I again find myself in such a phase. I don't often allow myself to indulge even when I really ought to - such as when the indlugence is no less valuable than whatever it is I tell myself I ought be doing. The software that makes this blog possible is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) which piqued my interest and set me on a week or two of reading about and experimenting with the language. (Tangent: when I was first developing an interest in computers and possibly programming, Ruby was suggested by a friend as a good first language for someone at my level. I never did pursue it aggressively, though I doubt I would have gotten very far - like someone setting out to learn a foreign language for the first time completely on their own, I had no framework on which to build). Now however, with eyes more towards the future, I've tried to set my eyes on my white whale of programming: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Perhaps finally I can come to terms with my own mind's tendencies and ride this wave into a deeper understanding and some day a branch in my career.

## Karkonosze

Ending the month on a lighter note, this final weekend the spouse and I took a small trip to [Karkonosze National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karkonosze_National_Park). We've been several times in past, but this was the first time in what still qualifies as winter and we were pleasantly suprised to find is still covered in snow.

While our favorite part of the path up was closed due to avalanche risk, the views were still lovely. Unlike in years past, we didn't make our way as far as [Śnieżka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sn%C4%9B%C5%BEka), but it still definitely worth the trip.
